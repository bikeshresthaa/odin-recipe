    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This recipe was very generously given us by Doma Wang, who runs one of our favourite Calcutta restaurants, The Blue Poppy.</p>
    <p>We like our chilli pork juicy, where stir-fried pork slices are accompanied with hot green chillies in every bite. Weâ€™re using the pork belly as it is fatty, but you could also use the leaner shoulder. This simple recipe leads to twice-cooked chilli pork. The meat is first boiled until tender and then stir-fried. This recipe is also reminiscent of the chilli pork on the menus of several Chinese restaurants in Calcutta.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <section>

        <ul>
            <li>1kg Pork belly or shoulder</li>
            <li>20 g ginger</li>
            <li>10 g garlic</li>
            <li>60 g tomato</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>25 g soy sauce</li>
            <li>20 g vegetable oil</li>
            <li>25 g green chillies</li>
            
        </ul>
    </section>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the pork in a pressure cooker, along with ginger, garlic, 50 g onions, 2 green chillies, 2 star anise, 18 g salt, and 350 g water. Boil the pork in the pressure cooker on medium heat for 45 minutes. Transfer the pork to a plate and chill it in the fridge for about 30 minutes, to enable clean slicing later on. Once chilled, slice the pork about 5 mm wide.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a wok on high heat. Add the star anise, sliced pork, and half the green chillies. Toss or stir until fat renders from the pork. This should take about 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then add the onion squares and fry for about 6 minutes until they are softened. Add the tomatoes and green chillies and fry for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Finally, add the soy sauce and salt. Toss to combine. You may garnish with some green onions if you like, but this is optional.</li>
        
    </ol>
